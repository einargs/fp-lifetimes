# Proof of composition of renaming (`ren*-comp`)
## Definitions:
`Ctxt*` is a context of type variables with `Kind`s.

`Ren* Œ¶ Œ®` is a function from an index in the context Œ¶ to an index in
the context Œ®.

`lift* p` lifts a renaming `p : Ren* Œ¶ Œ®` over a new type variable `t` of
kind `K`, returning a renaming `Ren* (Œ¶ , t : K) (Œ® , t : K)`. (Since the
actual code doesn't use named variables, but instead de brujin indicies, the
actual return type is `Ren* (Œ¶ ,* K) (Œ® ,* K)`.)

`Œ¶ ‚àã* K` is an index of kind `K` in the context Œ¶.

`Œ¶ ‚ä¢* K` is a type of kind `K` in the context `Œ¶`.

`ren* p t` takes a renaming `Ren* Œ¶ Œ®` and a type `Œ¶ ‚ä¢* K` and renames the
type variables in `t` so that it is in Œ® (i.e. turns it into `Œ® ‚ä¢* K`).

## Proof:
The goal is to prove that, given two renamings `p : Ren* Œ¶ Œ®` and
`p' : Ren* Œ® Œò`, renaming a type `a : Œ¶ ‚ä¢* J` by the composition of
p' and p (`p' ‚àò p`) is the same as renaming by p and then renaming by
p': `ren* (p' ‚àò p) a ‚â° ren* p' (ren* p a)`.

To prove this we begin by induction on the shape of `a`.

### `*var` case (a type variable)
This is trivially true by the way `ren*` is defined on the `*var` case;
it simply directly applies the renaming to the index inside the `*var`.

### `ùîπ` case (the boolean type)
This is trivially true, since `ùîπ` has no type variables in it.

### `t1 ‚áí t2` case (a function type)
In this case, we apply the induction hypothesis to t1 and t2. Then,
via congruence, we know the equality holds true for `t1 ‚áí t2`.

### `t1 ¬∑* t2` case (a type application)
In this case, we apply the induction hypothesis to t1 and t2. Then,
via congruence, we know the equality holds true for `t1 ¬∑* t2`.

### `*Œª t` case (a type level lambda)
`ren* p (*Œª t)` is defined on the `*Œª` as renaming the internal type t
by p lifted over the new type variable.
```
ren* p (*Œª t) = *Œª (ren* (lift* p) t)
```

Applying that to the goal, we now need to prove that renaming `t` by
the lifted composition of p' and p (`lift* (p' ‚àò p)`) is the same as
renaming by the lifted p (`lift* p`) and then by the lifted p' (`lift* p'`).
```
*Œª (ren* (lift* (p' ‚àò p)) t) ‚â° *Œª (ren* (lift* p') (ren* (lift* p) t))
```

Congruence means we don't have to worry about the enclosing `*Œª`; as long
as we can prove the internal types are equal, we're fine.
```
ren* (lift* (p' ‚àò p)) t ‚â° ren* (lift* p') (ren* (lift* p) t)
```

Our induction hypothesis is that renaming by the composition of a lifted
p' and lifted p (`lift* p' ‚àò lift* p`) is the same as renaming by a lifted p
and then a lifted p'.
```
ren* (lift* p' ‚àò lift* p) t ‚â° ren* (lift* p') (ren* (lift* p) t)
```

The left side of our induction hypothesis is already correct, so we just need
an equality that shows that the lifted composition p' of p (`lift* (p' ‚àò p)`)
is the same as the composition lifted p' of lifted p (`lift* p' ‚àò lift* p`).
Once we have that equality, we can use a variant of the congruence principle
for `ren*` to show that if the renaming functions are equal extensionally
(i.e. they return the same output for all inputs) then renaming by them is
equal as well. (This is `ren*-cong` in the code.)
```
lift* (p' ‚àò p) ‚â° lift* p' ‚àò lift* p
```

As it turns out, this is a principle we've already proven and called `lift*-comp`,
which is quite trivial to prove, not even requiring induction, only simple
discrimination on the case (since `lift*` doesn't recurse in its own definition).

### `*‚àÄ t` case (a polymorphic type)
Proof is the same as for the `*Œª` case.
